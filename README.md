Teradata Challenge 2016 dataset

This dataset was a part of Teradata Challenge 2016.

In this challenge, we will try to achieve below :

o	Is there any relationship between the amount of time spent working with individual clients (time to complete an assessment, time to complete resume, # of logged activities, etc.) and how quickly they are employed?

o	What measures should we utilize to measure process efficiency and program performance relevant at the Veteran Transition Specialist, office, and regional levels, and are there alternative measurement techniques to maximize reporting accuracy and efficiency?

o	Is it possible to correlate client and employer demographic data (candidate qualifications, geography, industry, desired career fields etc.) and our current method of matching clients with potential employers to identify new effective ways to help clients connect with companies we’ve built relationships with?

o	Does working with a volunteer raise the probability of a client getting hired or getting hired sooner? Are there certain volunteer activities that are more effective than others? Do volunteer activities increase the quality job obtained – perhaps determined through salary level? (Essentially, can we prove quantitatively that our volunteers are increasing the overall effectiveness of our program?)
